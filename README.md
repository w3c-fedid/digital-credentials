# Digital Credentials

ðŸ“„ [Digital Credentials API](https://www.w3.org/TR/digital-credentials/) builds upon the [Credential Management API](https://www.w3.org/TR/credential-management-1/) to enable secure and privacy-preserving issuance and exchange of digital credentials, such as identity documents. It facilitates authenticated interactions by representing digital credentials as instances of [`DigitalCredential`](https://www.w3.org/TR/digital-credentials/#dom-digitalcredential) â€” cryptographically verifiable claims about an individual's identity. These credentials can include government-issued documents like driver's licenses, with support for additional types envisioned in the future.

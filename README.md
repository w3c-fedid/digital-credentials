# Digital Credentials

ðŸ“„ [Digital credentials explainer](explainer.md) and [draft spec](https://w3c-fedid.github.io/digital-credentials/).

This draft (migrated to the Federated Identity on the Web WG in April 2025) specifies an API for user agents that would mediate access to, and representation of, verifiably-issued digital credentials.

These identities can range from government-issued documents, such as driver's licenses and passports, to start with, to other credential types, potentially in the future.

[Digital Credentials](https://w3c-fedid.github.io/digital-credentials/) builds upon [Credential Management](https://www.w3.org/TR/credential-management-1/) to enable the secure and private exchange of digital identity information. It facilitates authenticated interactions by representing digital credentials through the `DigitalCredential` interface, which embodies verifiable claims about an individual's identity.

## Scope

This project covers the requesting mechanisms for digital credentials, including secure presentation aspects. It does not yet encompass the issuance process for establishing a digital identity nor UI/UX considerations beyond privacy aspects related to data protection during the request process.

## Trying out the API

**ðŸš§ Note: The API is still extremely unstable and undergoing a lot of changes (almost daily!). ðŸš§**

However, if you want to try it out:

## Contributing

This is a draft (migrated to the Federated Identity on the Web WG in April 2025) under development. Contributions, feedback, and discussions are highly encouraged to refine and enhance the API specification.

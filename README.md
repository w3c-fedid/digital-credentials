# Digital Credentials

📄 The [Digital Credentials API](https://www.w3.org/TR/digital-credentials/) builds upon the [Credential Management API](https://www.w3.org/TR/credential-management-1/) to enable secure and privacy-preserving issuance and exchange of digital credentials, such as identity documents. It facilitates authenticated interactions by representing digital credentials as [`DigitalCredential`](https://www.w3.org/TR/digital-credentials/#dom-digitalcredential) instances—cryptographically verifiable claims about an individual's identity. These credentials can include government-issued documents like driver's licenses, with support for additional types envisioned in the future.

## Scope

See the [Scope section of the specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/digital-credentials/#scope) for normative details.

This specification defines how digital credentials are represented, requested, and issued securely by user agents. It standardizes the interface for interoperable credential exchange on the web.

## Trying out the API

- [Try the API in Chrome](https://digitalcredentials.dev/docs/requirements/)

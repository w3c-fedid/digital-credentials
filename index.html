        This document specifies an API to enable [=user agents=] to mediate
        presentation and issuance of digital credentials such as a driver's
        license, government-issued identification card, and/or [=credential
        type examples|other types of digital credential=]. The API builds on
        [[[credential-management-1]]] as a means by which to request or issue a
        digital credential from a user agent or underlying platform.

      <p>
        This is an unofficial proposal.
      </p>
    </section>
    <h2>
      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      This document defines an API enabling a website to request presentation
      and issuance of a [=digital credential=].
    </p>
    <p>
      The API design is agnostic to both credential [=digital
      credential/presentation requests|presentation=] [=digital
      credential/exchange protocols=], credential [=digital credential/issuance
      request|issuance=] [=digital credential/issuance protocols|protocols=]
      and credential formats. However, to promote interoperability this
      document includes a [[[#protocol-registry]]].
    </p>
    <p>
      The API is designed to support the following goals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep the acts of [=digital credential/presentation
      requests|requesting=] and [=digital credential/issuance
      requests|issuing=] separate from the specific [=digital
      credential/exchange protocol=] and [=digital credential/issuance
      protocol=] respectively; thereby enabling the extensibility of such
      protocols and credential formats.
      </li>
      <li>Require [=digital credential/presentation requests=] and [=digital
      credential/issuance requests=] to be unencrypted, enabling user-agent
      inspection for risk analysis.
      </li>
      <li>Assume opaque (i.e., encrypted) [=digital credential/presentation
      responses=] and [=digital credential/issuance responses=], enabling
      issuers, verifiers, and holders to control where potentially sensitive
      personally identifiable information is exposed.
      </li>
      <li>Require [=transient activation=] to perform [=digital
      credential/presentation requests=] or [=digital credential/issuance
      requests=], ensuring that sites cannot silently query for nor issue
      digital credentials, nor communicate with wallet providers, without the
      user's active participation and confirmation of each action.
      </li>
      <li>Enable platform-provided credential selection UX when multiple wallet
      applications have credentials that match a [=digital
      credential/presentation request=].
      </li>
      <li>Enable platform-provided wallet selection UX when multiple wallet
      applications support an [=digital credential/issuance request=].
      </li>
      <li>Enable platforms to provide secure cross-device [=digital
      credential/presentation requests=] and [=digital credential/issuance
      requests=] with proximity checks.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p id="credential-type-examples">
      [=Digital credentials=] of many types can be presented and issued using
      this API. <dfn data-lt="credential type examples">Examples of these
      types</dfn> include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a driving license, passport, or other identity card issued by a
      government institution
      </li>
      <li>a travel authorization document issued by an embassy or consulate
      </li>
      <li>a proof of employment issued by a public or private organization
      </li>
      <li>a proof of education or professional training issued by an
      institution
      </li>
      <li>and many other scenarios as described in <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/">Verifiable Credentials Use
      Cases</a>

        The Digital Credentials API integrates into a complex ecosystem with
        multiple technology layers and various participants (including but not
        limited to Verifiers, Holders and Issuers), each of which have to
        consider different aspects of user privacy. This specification does not
        attempt to exhaustively list all considerations for the different
        participants. We would like to refer these parties to a variety of
        other resources that explore the digital credentials threat model more
        holistically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>[[[credential-considerations]]]

        <li>...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Instead, these considerations focus on the Digital Credentials API
        itself, and describe how user agents can satisfy their <a data-cite=
        "privacy-principles#dfn-user-agent-duties">user agent duties</a> in an
        implementation of the API, taking into account the relevant privacy
        properties of the ecosystem it interacts with.
      </p>
      <p>
        The privacy considerations for digital credentials are not static. They
        will evolve over time as the ecosystem matures, and may be informed by
        the behavior of other actors in the ecosystem, improvements in other
        layers of the stack, new threats to user privacy, as well as changing
        societal norms and regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is expected that the various groups involved in the design and
        implementation of the Digital Credentials API actively monitor the
        evolving privacy landscape and participate in the corresponding
        evolution of the API.
      </p>
      <section data-cite="vc-data-model#spectrum-of-privacy">
        <h3>
          Spectrum of Privacy
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Digital Credentials API serves a variety of use cases with
          different grades of data disclosure and individual users with
          different preferences depending on the context that they are in.
          Notably, the privacy properties of a credential exchange mediated by
          this API could be mandated by the legal and regulatory environment of
          an individual user.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that some users may not want, or be allowed, to use the
          most privacy-preserving means of exchanging credential information.
          Nonetheless, user agents need to serve users with an experience that
          is private by default and protect them from harm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of this spectrum of preferences and use cases, it may be
          difficult for a user agent to discern whether a user means to expose
          their personal information or is being tricked into doing so. It is
          thus the user agent's responsibility to ensure that every user
          understands what data they are sharing and who will participate in
          the exchange of information, before the exchange begins.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Exchange Protocol and Credential Format
        </h3>
        <p>
          Because the Digital Credentials API sits at the center of an exchange
          that involves multiple independent parties, the exchange protocol and
          credential format used by these parties for exchanging user
          information are crucial to the user agent's goal of protecting user
          privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The protocol registry for the Digital Credentials API is designed to
          ensure that, among other requirements, supported protocols facilitate
          specific privacy-enhancing capabilities. Protocols are required to
          undergo privacy review by the W3C's <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/privacy/">Privacy Working Group</a>.

        <h5>
          Selective disclosure
        </h5>
        <p>
          <a data-cite=
          "credential-considerations#selective-disclosure">Selective
          disclosure</a> is a fundamental technique for <a data-cite=
          "privacy-principles#data-minimization">data minimization</a> that
          allows holders to share the minimum required information that is
          requested by a verifier. Protocols are expected to facilitate
          selective disclosure by allowing the verifier to specify the exact
          claims needed.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Unlinkable presentations
        </h5>
        <p>
          <a data-cite=
          "credential-considerations#unlinkable-presentations">Unlinkability</a>
          is a property that ensures that, if a user presents attributes from a
          credential multiple times, verifiers cannot link these separate
          presentations to conclude they concern the same user
          (verifier-verifier linkability), or that verifiers can not collude
          with issuers to report the exchange of a credential from a wallet to
          the issuer (verifier-issuer linkability). The former is a property
          that can be maintained by the wallet and issuer, e.g. through issuing
          fresh credentials for individual verifiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the latter is achievable, e.g. through <a data-cite=
          "vc-data-model#zero-knowledge-proofs">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a>,
          design choices of the API such as encrypted responses make it
          impossible for a user agent to prove that verifier-issuer
          unlinkability was achieved in practice. Nonetheless, protocols are
          requested to limit linkability wherever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that unlinkability is exclusively a consideration for attributes
          that can not be linked to a specific user identity. Inherently
          linkable attributes such as names, driver's license numbers or phone
          numbers do not benefit from unlinkability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the Digital Credentials API, the user agent can help
          verifiers and wallets exchange unlinkable attributes, but it can not
          guarantee that no linkable information is passed between verifiers
          and wallets. It is recommended that user agents account for this fact
          in their user permission experience.
        </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="279">
          Which level of unlinkability is the goal for this API? Can we
          normatively enforce support for any particular unlinkability features
          as part of the protocol registry inclusion criteria?
        </p>
        <h5>
          "Phone home" mechanisms
        </h5>
        <p>
          <a data-cite="credential-considerations#no-phoning-home">"Phoning
          home"</a> refers to scenarios where the presentation or verification
          of a digital credential causes a notification or communication back
          to the issuer or another central entity, which can lead to tracking
          and profiling of individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar to unlinkability, it is impossible for user agents to ensure
          that an issuer isn't actively involved in the creation or validation
          of credential presentations after a user has given permission to
          proceed with a credential request. From that point on, the wallet
          application owns this decision. While some wallets can be considered
          user agents, it is generally recommended that the user agent
          implementing the Digital Credentials API designs its permission
          experience to prevent <a href=
          "#permission-prior-to-wallet-selection">exposure of a request to the
          wallet application</a> before user confirmation (keeping in mind
          <a href="#multiple-user-agents">considerations for integrating
          multiple cooperating user agents</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Protocols are required to support mechanisms that allow issuers,
          wallets and verifiers avoid or reduce the dependence on "phone home"
          mechanisms.

          Which level of unlinkability is the goal for this API? To what degree
          can the spec mandate restrictions to issuer involvement?
        </p>
        <h5>
          Unlinkable revocation
        </h5>
        <p>
          A common instance of issuer involvement in a credential exchange is
          for credential revocation checks. This is particularly challenging
          when presentations are intended to be verifier-issuer unlinkable.
          When credential presentations are made unlinkable through the use of
          e.g. Zero-Knowledge Proofs, the credential formats used in protocols
          are expected to support offline revocation methods such as <a href=
          "https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/657.pdf">Cryptographic
          Accumulators</a>. It is further expected that protocol design and
          specification discourages the involvement of verifiers for the
          purpose of revocation where possible.
        </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="280">
          We should discuss whether unlinkable revocation techniques are
          practical enough to be required normatively.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Support for user transparency, permission and consent
        </h5>
        <p>
          User understanding and participation are non-negotiable properties of
          a credential exchange. The protocol is expected to help all involved
          parties enable user participation by providing the information vital
          for informed permission and/or consent.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Support for verifier authorization
        </h5>
        <p>
          Verifier authorization refers to the process by which a verifier
          proves its identity and demonstrates that it is legitimately entitled
          to request specific attributes or credentials. This is particularly
          useful when exchanging sensitive data, such as from government-issued
          credentials. Verifier authorization can limit unnecessary or abusive
          credential requests, and ensure that a verifier's access is
          restricted to the specific credential attributes it registered for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Checking verifier authorization is usually handled by the wallet, but
          user agents could find the presence of such a scheme helpful in
          preventing API abuse and designing a well-informed user permission
          experience.
        </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="281">
          Should we require protocols to include provisions that allow user
          agents to understand verifier authorization?
        </p>
        <h5>
          Encrypting credential responses
        </h5>
        <p>
          To prevent exposure of user information to other parties in
          "transit", for example browser extensions loaded on verifier pages,
          and to encourage secure storage of user credentials by the verifier,
          protocols are required to support and mandate encrypted responses in
          a credential exchange.

          User Permission and Transparency
        </h3>
        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress"></p>
        <p>
          The Digital Credentials API enables the sharing of highly personal,
          sensitive, and at-risk user information with websites via
          credentials, potentially granting the ability to track users online
          and offline, through permanent, unique, irrevocable, cross-context
          identifiers. It also reveals parts of the user's browsing activity as
          well as their intent to identify to specific websites and/or wallets.
          One crucial responsibility of the user agent in a credential request
          is to gather permission from the user to proceed with the exchange of
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Important context details that are needed for a user to make an
          informed decision about proceeding with a credential exchange include
          the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The origin of the verifier that requests the credential.
          </li>
          <li>The information that is being requested, or that would be
          revealed by responding to the request.
          </li>
          <li>Whether presenting this information will enable tracking.
          </li>
          <li>Which wallet(s) can be used to fulfill the credential request.
          </li>
          <li>Which credential would be used to share the requested
          information.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is advised that user agents in their implementation ensure that
          the details listed are fully disclosed to the user before an exchange
          of any user-related information occurs.

          Integrating Multiple User Agents
        </h4>
        <p>
          Depending on the technical architecture of a user's system, it is
          likely that the definition of a "user agent" will include multiple
          cooperating layers of the software stack, such as a browser and the
          operating system. The greatest priority for these layers has to be a
          safe and well-informed user permission experience. As such,
          integration can be vital for user safety. Some layers may hold
          information that is inaccessible by other layers, such as the
          availability of a user's credentials. Overprompting or prompting
          without sufficient context could lead to (exploitable) confusion and
          prompt blindness.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason, user agents prompting for permission are encouraged
          to integrate software layers for an ideal user experience, if they
          consider it safe to do so. This could happen, for example, if a
          browser trusts the API contract of an operating system to show an
          appropriate prompt, and thus does not show a prompt itself.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Permission Prior to Wallet Selection
        </h4>
        <p>
          As part of the user permission flow, the user agent needs to ensure
          that users retain the power to choose whether to forward a credential
          request to a wallet, and which wallet to select. This is due to the
          information disclosure that happens as part of the request, and the
          ability of wallets to retain or share this information at the time of
          the request.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Permission vs. Consent
        </h4>
        <p>
          The permission mediated by the user agent is not consent, which has
          specific legal definitions which can vary among different legal and
          regulatory environments and may need to be collected by the digital
          wallet before sharing information with the verifier, or by the
          verifier itself before initiating the request. With frameworks and
          regulations for obtaining consent still being developed, this API
          aims to enable the exchange of the necessary information, which could
          include the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The privacy policy of the verifier receiving the credential.
          </li>
          <li>The purpose for which the verifier is requesting the information.
          </li>
          <li>What the information will be used for.
          </li>
          <li>How the information will be shared or retained.
          </li>
          <li>Any evaluations and attestations of this information, if
          available.
          </li>
          <li>Assertions of the verifier's legimitacy and registration for
          accessing the credential, such as <a href=
          "https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/annexes/annex-2/annex-2-high-level-requirements.md#a2327-topic-27---registration-of-pid-providers-providers-of-qeaas-pub-eaas-and-non-qualified-eaas-and-relying-parties">
            EUDI access and registration certificates</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As more of this information becomes available in a structured format,
          we expect user agents and this specification to leverage it to
          improve the user permission experience as well.
